# **Examples of using the AnalogGym with the [relational graph neural network and reinforcement learning algorithm](https://github.com/ChrisZonghaoLi/sky130_ldo_rl)**
## Simulation Reference

To understand how the simulations are set up and executed, you can refer to the following scripts:

- For the **Amplifier** simulation, refer to [main_AMP.py](https://github.com/CODA-Team/AnalogGym/blob/main/RGNN_RL/main_AMP.py).


- For the **LDO** simulation, refer to [main_LDO.py](https://github.com/CODA-Team/AnalogGym/blob/main/RGNN_RL/main_LDO.py).


These scripts provide detailed examples of how the simulations are run, including the optimization process for each circuit.

## File Descriptions

Here is a breakdown of key files and directories:

- `/saved_agents`, `/saved_memories`, `/saved_weights`: Stores data generated during the simulation process.
- `/mosfet_model`: Contains the SKY130 PDK (Process Design Kit).
- `/simulations`: Contains SPICE files and is where Ngspice runs.
- `environment.yml`: Defines the environmental requirements for the simulation.
- `Dockerfile`: Describes how to build the Docker images.
- `ckt_graphs.py`: Defines graph info and specifications for AMP and LDO circuits.
- `dev_params.py`: Extracts device parameters (e.g., threshold voltage, transconductance) used as RL observations.
- `AMP_NMCF.py`: Defines the AMP environment (Gymnasium compatible).
- `LDO_TB.py`: Defines the LDO environment (Gymnasium compatible).
- `ddpg.py`: Implements the DDPG algorithm.
- `models.py`: Contains various Graph Neural Network (GNN) models.
- `utils.py`: Provides utility functions (e.g., extracting simulation performance).
- `main_AMP.py`: Runs optimization for AMP circuits.
- `main_LDO.py`: Runs optimization for LDO circuits.
- `torch-1.13.1+cpu-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl`, `torch_cluster-1.6.1+pt113cpu-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl`, `torch_scatter-2.1.1+pt113cpu-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl`, `torch_sparse-0.6.17+pt113cpu-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl`, `torch_spline_conv-1.2.2+pt113cpu-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl`: Pre-downloaded PyTorch files for setup.

## Supplementary Information

Please note that the command `conda install source-forge ngspice` can only install up to version `ngspice-41`, which doesnâ€™t support DC scanning for temperature and current in circuit simulations. To use these features, manually download and replace with `ngspice-42` or `ngspice-43` from [ngspice on SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ng-spice-rework/files/ng-spice-rework/43/).

To replace the older version, navigate to the following directory (assuming the `analoggym-env` conda environment is already created):

```bash
/Anaconda/envs/analoggym-env/Library/bin
```
Overwrite the old `ngspice.exe` with the newer version. Ensure that the `analoggym-env` environment meets all requirements in `environment.yml`.
```
