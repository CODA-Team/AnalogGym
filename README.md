## About AnalogGym

This repository is the analog circuit synthesis testing suite, **AnalogGym**.

AnalogGym encompasses 30 circuit topologies in five key categories: sensing front ends, voltage references, AMPs, low dropout regulators (LDOs), and phase-locked loops (PLLs). 
Among these, the LDOs and AMPs support the open-source [Ngspice](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/) simulator and the [SkyWater](https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk)  process design kit (PDK), allowing for greater accessibility and reproducibility. 



## Getting Started


<font color="red">Write a simple "out-of-box" run example here. Maybe a Docker container.</font>

## Use 


<font color="red">Write some simple table of contents here. Like how to set up simulators. How to use commercial tools, PDK, etc. Refer the readers to the corresponding doc</font>

For a detailed tutorial on using Ngspice, please refer to [this link](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/tutorials.html).

Detailed documentations can be found in [doc](https://coda-team.github.io/AnalogGym/)
